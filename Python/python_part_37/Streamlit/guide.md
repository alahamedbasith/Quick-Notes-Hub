# **Streamlit Guide**

## **Streamlit Definition**

* Streamlit is an open-source Python library for building **interactive web apps** for data science and machine learning projects.
* Allows Python scripts to be turned into **shareable apps** without front-end knowledge.

## **Advantages**

* Easy to use; no HTML/CSS/JS needed.
* Fast prototyping for dashboards and ML apps.
* Integrates with popular Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly).
* Automatically updates apps on code changes.
* Supports deployment on Streamlit Cloud or Docker.
* Open-source and community-supported.

## **Disadvantages**

* Limited layout flexibility compared to frameworks like Flask/Django.
* Not ideal for large-scale production applications.
* No built-in authentication (experimental support exists).
* Performance may drop with very large datasets.

## **Topics**

* Installation & First App
* Core Components (text, buttons, sliders, input fields, file uploader)
* Layouts & Pages
* Data Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
* Using Pandas DataFrames interactively
* Connecting ML models & showing predictions
