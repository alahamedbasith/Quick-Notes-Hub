**Debugging:**
Debugging is the process of **finding and fixing bugs** in your code, mainly during development. It is **interactive**, allowing you to step through code line by line, inspect variables, and understand the program flow. Debugging tools include IDE debuggers like **VS Code**, **PyCharm**, or Python’s **pdb**.

**Key points about debugging:**

* Purpose: Find and fix bugs
* Usage Time: Development
* Interactivity: Step-by-step inspection
* Output: IDE or console
* Effect on Program: Pauses or stops at breakpoints
* Best For: Immediate problem solving
* Pros: Can inspect variables and program flow in real-time
* Cons: Only works when actively debugging

**Logging:**
Logging is the process of **recording information about program execution** for later analysis. It is **passive**, meaning the program continues running while logs capture errors, warnings, or events. Common tools include Python’s **logging module**, which can write to files, console, or monitoring systems.

**Key points about logging:**

* Purpose: Record program execution info
* Usage Time: Development and Production
* Interactivity: Passive recording
* Output: File, console, or monitoring system
* Effect on Program: Does not pause execution
* Best For: Long-term monitoring and error tracking
* Pros: Helps track issues in production and keeps historical records
* Cons: Does not fix bugs; excessive logging can slow the program
